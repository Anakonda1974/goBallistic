# Project Tasks

This file lists outstanding tasks and opportunities for future improvements.

- [ ] Integrate GPU-based height map generation in `PlanetManager`.
- [ ] Provide screenshots and documentation for the new `PlateauModifier`.
- [ ] Expand project README with setup and usage instructions.
- [ ] Explore using Web Workers for asynchronous chunk generation.
- [ ] Implement seeded global Voronoi segmentation for tectonic plates.
- [ ] Assign each plate a random tangent motion vector.
- [ ] Classify boundaries as divergent, convergent, or transform.
- [ ] Modify the heightmap around boundaries to form trenches, ridges, and volcanoes.
- [ ] Introduce a `Plate` structure with center, vector, type, and vertex list.
- [ ] Add a debug view to visualize color-coded plates.
