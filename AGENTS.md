- [x] Implement seeded global Voronoi segmentation for tectonic plates.
- [x] Assign each plate a random tangent motion vector.
- [x] Classify boundaries as divergent, convergent, or transform.
- [x] Modify the heightmap around boundaries to form trenches, ridges, and volcanoes.
- [x] Introduce a `Plate` structure with center, vector, type, and vertex list.
- [x] Add a debug view to visualize color-coded plates.

- [x] Integrate GPU-based height map generation in `PlanetManager`.

- [x] Expand project README with setup and usage instructions.
- [x] Explore using Web Workers for asynchronous chunk generation.

## New Tasks
